        ‍What is React ?
        React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs) on the web. React is a declarative, component based library that allows developers to build reusable UI components and It follows the Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) approach, which optimizes rendering performance by minimizing DOM updates.
