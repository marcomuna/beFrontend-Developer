    <h2>Introduction to JavaScript</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        avaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and
        interpreted compiled programming language. It is also known as the
        scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of
        web pages, and many non-browser environments also use it.
      </li>
      <li>
        JavaScript is a weakly typed language (dynamically typed). JavaScript
        can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side
        developments. JavaScript is both an imperative and declarative type of
        language.
      </li>
      <li>
        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and
        Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control
        structures, and statements.
      </li>
      <li>
        Client-side: It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document
        Object Model (DOM). Like if client-side extensions allow an application
        to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as
        mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. Useful libraries for the
        client side are AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS, and so many others.
      </li>
      <li>
        Server-side: It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a
        server. For if the server-side extensions allow an application to
        communicate with a database, and provide continuity of information from
        one invocation to another of the application, or perform file
        manipulations on a server. The useful framework which is the most famous
        these days is node.js.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Link JavaScript File in HTML ?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>JavaScript can be added to HTML file in two ways:</li>
      <li>
        Internal JS: We can add JavaScript directly to our HTML file by writing
        the code inside the
        <big
          ><b><i>script</i></b></big
        >
        tag. The script tag can either be placed inside the head or the body tag
        according to the requirement.
      </li>
      <li>
        External JS: We can write JavaScript code in another files having an
        extension.js and then link this file inside the
        <big
          ><b><i>Head</i></b></big
        >
        tag of the HTML file in which we want to add this code.
      </li>
    </ul>
